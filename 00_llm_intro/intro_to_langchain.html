This is particularly true for language tasks that are culture-dependent. One such example is the area of multilingual sentiment analysis, where affective markers can be subtle and deeply ensconced in culture. This work presents the most extensive open massively multilingual corpus of datasets for training sentiment models. The corpus consists of 79 manually selected datasets from over 350 datasets reported in the scientific literature based on strict quality criteria. The corpus covers 27 languages representing 6 language families. Datasets can be queried using several linguistic and functional features. In addition, we present a multi-faceted sentiment classification benchmark summarizing hundreds of experiments conducted on different base models, training objectives, dataset collections, and fine-tuning strategies.</span></span>

This workshop is designed to impart an in-depth understanding of fundamental concepts of Reinforcement Learning (states, actions, rewards, value functions, policies) and Generative Language Models. A theoretical comparison with Supervised Learning paradigm will be discussed, along with the advantages RLHF optimization brings to reducing biases, and overcoming sparse reward issues. Participants will engage in hands-on activities involving RLHF training with simplified models, hyperparameter tuning of RLHF models, and diving into existing RLHF programming frameworks.</span></span>
<span id="cb86-14"><a href="#cb86-14" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="st">Konrad Wojtasik Information Retrieval   Introduction to modern information retrieval    Information retrieval plays a crucial role in modern systems, finding applications across diverse domains and industries. Its relevance spans from web search and recommendation systems to product search and health and legal information retrieval. Information retrieval is not only essential for traditional search applications but also plays a vital role in retrieval-augmented Question Answering systems. Additionally, it serves as a valuable mechanism to prevent Large Language Models from generating incorrect or hallucinated information. Moreover, it ensures that their knowledge remains accurate and up-to-date.

Learning representations for graphs is especially challenging due to the relational nature of such data, i.e., one must reflect both the rich attribute space and graph structure in the embedding vectors. During this workshop, I will show how to use the PyTorch-Geometric library to easily build graph representations and solve a variety of applications. We will explore node, edge and graph-level representations through the prism of their associated downstream tasks and corresponding deep learning models (Graph Neural Networks).</span></span>

"Uncertainty estimation is a critical aspect of artificial intelligence systems, enabling them to quantify their confidence and provide reliable predictions. However, accurately assessing uncertainty becomes increasingly challenging when AI models encounter scenarios outside their training data distribution. This workshop, titled ""Does Representation Know What It Doesn't Know?,"" aims to explore the concept of uncertainty estimation in AI systems and delve into the question of whether representations within these systems possess the ability to recognize their own limitations. During the workshop, we will investigate the various techniques and methodologies employed in uncertainty estimation, such as Bayesian approaches and deep learning-based techniques. We will analyze the strengths and limitations of these approaches and discuss their implications for real-world applications.</span></span>

However, there are many subjective problems that should respect users’ individual points of view. At the first glance, disagreement and non-regular annotations can be seen as noise that drags the performance of NLP task detection models down. As we know, the ability to think and perceive the environment differently is natural to humans as such. Therefore, it is crucial to include this observation while building predictive models in order to reflect the setup close to reality. As simple as this may seem, it is important to keep in mind that the key ideas behind NLP phenomenon detection, such as gold standard, agreement coefficients, or the evaluation itself need to be thoroughly analyzed and reconsidered especially for subjective NLP tasks like hate speech detection, prediction of emotional elicitation, sense of humor, sarcasm detection, or even sentiment analysis. Such NLP tasks come with each complexity of their own, especially within the aspect of subjectivity, therefore making them difficult to solve compared to non-subjective tasks.</span></span>

The parameter optimization process based on gradient descent works well when the data set is sufficiently large and fully available during the training process.

However, by default, we cannot control its sampling process, i.e., we cannot generate a sample with a specific set of attributes. The current approach is model retraining with additional inputs and different architecture, which requires time and computational resources. During this hands-on workshop we will go through a method which enables to generate objects with a given set of attributes without retraining the base model. For this purpose, we will utilize the normalizing flow models - Conditional Masked Autoregressive Flow and Conditional Real NVP, and plug-in networks resulting in the Flow Plugin Network.</span></span>

Mateusz Gniewkowski XAI Model Agnostic Explanations Techniques  "Machine learning models can often be complex and difficult to understand, therefore it is important to be able to explain how these models work, as they are increasingly used in a wide range of industries and applications.
The workshop will start by discussing some basic ways to explain machine learning models, such as using feature importance measures, decision trees, and visualization tools. However, the focus will then shift to model-agnostic techniques, which can be applied to any type of machine learning model.
The techniques that will be covered in the workshop include LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). These libraries are designed to provide more transparent and understandable explanations for machine learning models, even when the models themselves are complex or difficult to interpret."
Piotr Bielak    Representation learning Introduction to graph representation learning   In recent years, representation learning has attracted much attention both in the research community and industrial applications. Learning representations for graphs is especially challenging due to the relational nature of such data, i.e., one must reflect both the rich attribute space and graph structure in the embedding vectors. During this workshop, I will show how to use the PyTorch-Geometric library to easily build graph representations and solve a variety of applications. We will explore node, edge and graph-level representations through the prism of their associated downstream tasks and corresponding deep learning models (Graph Neural Networks).
Denis Janiak    Representation learning, Bayesian methods   Does Representation Know What It Doesn't Know?  "Uncertainty estimation is a critical aspect of artificial intelligence systems, enabling them to quantify their confidence and provide reliable predictions. However, accurately assessing uncertainty becomes increasingly challenging when AI models encounter scenarios outside their training data distribution. This workshop, titled ""Does Representation Know What It Doesn't Know?,"" aims to explore the concept of uncertainty estimation in AI systems and delve into the question of whether representations within these systems possess the ability to recognize their own limitations. During the workshop, we will investigate the various techniques and methodologies employed in uncertainty estimation, such as Bayesian approaches and deep learning-based techniques. We will analyze the strengths and limitations of these approaches and discuss their implications for real-world applications.
Furthermore, the workshop will delve into the concept of representation learning and its impact on uncertainty estimation. We will examine whether AI systems can effectively recognize when they are faced with novel or out-of-distribution inputs. Additionally, we will explore approaches to measure and improve representation awareness, enabling models to identify areas of uncertainty and seek further guidance or human intervention when necessary.
By the end of the workshop, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the state-of-the-art techniques for uncertainty estimation and its importance in building robust AI systems. They will also gain insights into the fundamental question of whether representations within AI models possess the capability to identify areas of uncertainty and adapt accordingly. "
Albert Sawczyn  Representation learning Knowledge Graph Representation Learning Knowledge graphs have emerged as powerful tools for organizing and representing structured information in various domains, enabling efficient data integration, inference, and knowledge discovery. Knowledge graph representation learning aims to capture the rich semantic relationships and contextual information within knowledge graphs, facilitating effective knowledge inference and reasoning. This workshop aims to introduce the fundamental challenge of learning representations for knowledge graphs and highlight their significance in practical applications. Practical demonstrations will show how to easily learn representation using the PyKEEN library and how to apply it to a real-world NLP problem. 
Jakub Binkowski Representation learning Generative models for graphs    After many advancements in the realm of Graph Representation Learning, graph generation gained much attention due to its vast range of applications (e.g. drug design). Nonetheless, due to the nature of graph data, this task is very difficult and further breakthroughs still need to be discovered. Hence the workshop will provide a ground understanding of the selected methods and problems associated with graph generation. During the workshop, I will show the most important methods in theory and practice. I will show how to implement these methods leveraging Pytorch Geometric library. We will go through training and evaluation using common datasets.
Kamil Kanclerz  NLP, Personalization    Subjective problems in NLP  "A unified gold standard commonly exploited in natural language processing (NLP) tasks requires high inter-annotator agreement. However, there are many subjective problems that should respect users’ individual points of view. At the first glance, disagreement and non-regular annotations can be seen as noise that drags the performance of NLP task detection models down. As we know, the ability to think and perceive the environment differently is natural to humans as such. Therefore, it is crucial to include this observation while building predictive models in order to reflect the setup close to reality. As simple as this may seem, it is important to keep in mind that the key ideas behind NLP phenomenon detection, such as gold standard, agreement coefficients, or the evaluation itself need to be thoroughly analyzed and reconsidered especially for subjective NLP tasks like hate speech detection, prediction of emotional elicitation, sense of humor, sarcasm detection, or even sentiment analysis. Such NLP tasks come with each complexity of their own, especially within the aspect of subjectivity, therefore making them difficult to solve compared to non-subjective tasks.

During the workshop, the participants will be introduced to the novel deep neural architectures leveraging various user representations. Moreover, the user-centered data setups will be explained in comparison to their ground truth equivalents. Additionally, the personalized evaluation techniques will be presented as the methods providing further insight into model ability to understand differences between various user perspectives."
Mateusz Wójcik  MLOps, continual learning   Continual Learning - techniques and applications    "Recently, neural architectures have become effective and widely used in various domains. The parameter optimization process based on gradient descent works well when the data set is sufficiently large and fully available during the training process. But what if we don’t have all the data available during training? What if the number of classes increase? As a result, we have to manually retrain the models from scratch ensuing a time-consuming process.

During this workshop you will learn about the Continual Learning and its applications. We will discuss the catastrophic forgetting and explore various techniques that trying to prevent it starting from simple neural networks up to modern LLMs. As a result, you will understand why we need Continual Learning and how to apply it to existing or new models."
Patryk Wielopolski  Generative Models   Conditional object generation using pre-trained models and plug-in networks Generative models have gained many Machine Learning practitioners’ attention in the last years resulting in models such as StyleGAN for human face generation or PointFlow for the 3D point cloud generation. However, by default, we cannot control its sampling process, i.e., we cannot generate a sample with a specific set of attributes. The current approach is model retraining with additional inputs and different architecture, which requires time and computational resources. During this hands-on workshop we will go through a method which enables to generate objects with a given set of attributes without retraining the base model. For this purpose, we will utilize the normalizing flow models - Conditional Masked Autoregressive Flow and Conditional Real NVP, and plug-in networks resulting in the Flow Plugin Network.
Michał Czuba    Network Science Complex networks part II - spreading processes  Two years ago, the world faced SARS-CoV-2 and the biggest pandemic in the century. Since last winter, with an incursion of Russian troops in Ukraine, all civilised countries have been subjected to misinformation. This year with an election in Poland, a festival of campaign promises has started. The nature of these three examples is complex and hard to analyse. Nonetheless, one of the approaches leading to understanding and controlling such processes is a network simulation. During this workshop, you will learn an essential toolkit to model and analyse spreading phenomena in complex networks. You will understand how to simulate such processes as epidemics or opinion dynamics and how to identify key spreaders of fake news or the most fragile individuals to be vaccinated in the first place.
Mateusz Nurek   Network Science Complex networks part I - social network analysis   Computational network science is a field of artificial intelligence that analyses graphs in applied problems involving social, transportation, epidemiological or energy issues.
